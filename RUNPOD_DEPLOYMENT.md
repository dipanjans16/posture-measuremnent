# RunPod Deployment Guide for Posture Measurement API

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying your MediaPipe-based posture analysis API on RunPod's serverless platform.

## Overview

Your posture measurement API has been adapted for RunPod serverless deployment with the following components:

- **RunPod Handler** (`runpod_handler.py`): Serverless function that processes base64-encoded images
- **Docker Container** (`Dockerfile`): Optimized container with MediaPipe and OpenCV dependencies
- **Requirements** (`requirements_runpod.txt`): RunPod-specific dependencies including RunPod SDK
- **Testing Script** (`test_runpod_local.py`): Local testing before deployment
- **Build Script** (`build_and_deploy.sh`): Automated deployment script

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** installed and running
2. **RunPod Account** with API access
3. **Container Registry** (Docker Hub, RunPod Registry, or private registry)
4. **Demo Images** in `demo_images/` folder for testing

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Install Docker** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   ```

2. **Login to your container registry**:
   ```bash
   # For Docker Hub
   docker login
   
   # For RunPod Registry
   docker login registry.runpod.io
   ```

3. **Update registry configuration**:
   Edit `build_and_deploy.sh` and update these variables:
   ```bash
   REGISTRY_URL="your-registry-url"  # e.g., "your-dockerhub-username" or "registry.runpod.io/your-username"
   IMAGE_NAME="posture-measurement-api"
   IMAGE_TAG="latest"
   ```

### Step 2: Test Locally (Recommended)

Before deploying, test the handler locally:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_runpod.txt
   ```

2. **Run local test**:
   ```bash
   python test_runpod_local.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Test the handler with demo images
   - Validate error handling
   - Show expected output format

### Step 3: Build and Deploy

1. **Make the build script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build_and_deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   ./build_and_deploy.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Build the Docker image with all dependencies
   - Push to your container registry
   - Provide the image URL for RunPod configuration

### Step 4: Configure RunPod Endpoint

1. **Go to RunPod Dashboard**:
   Visit [https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless)

2. **Create New Endpoint**:
   - Click "New Endpoint"
   - Choose "Custom Image"

3. **Configure the Endpoint**:
   ```yaml
   Image URI: your-registry-url/posture-measurement-api:latest
   
   Environment Variables:
   - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
   - PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
   
   Resources:
   - CPU: 2 cores (recommended)
   - Memory: 4GB (minimum for MediaPipe)
   - Storage: 10GB
   
   Scaling:
   - Min Workers: 0 (cost-effective)
   - Max Workers: 10 (adjust based on needs)
   - Idle Timeout: 30 seconds
   
   Timeouts:
   - Request Timeout: 120 seconds
   - Startup Timeout: 300 seconds
   ```

4. **Deploy the Endpoint**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the endpoint to become active

## Usage

### Input Format

Send POST requests to your RunPod endpoint. The handler supports two input formats:

**Simplified format (recommended):**
```json
{
  "front": "base64_encoded_image_string",
  "side": "base64_encoded_image_string"
}
```

**Detailed format (also supported):**
```json
{
  "input": {
    "front_image": "base64_encoded_image_string",
    "side_image": "base64_encoded_image_string"
  }
}
```

### Output Format

The API returns posture angles in this format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "front_view": {
      "shoulder_tilt": 2.34,
      "pelvic_tilt": -1.23,
      "head_tilt": 0.45,
      "body_tilt": 1.67
    },
    "side_view": {
      "back_tilt": 5.67,
      "neck_tilt": 15.23,
      "body_tilt": 3.45,
      "hip_tilt": -2.89
    }
  },
  "message": "Posture analysis completed successfully"
}
```

### Example Usage (Python)

```python
import requests
import base64
import json

# Encode images to base64
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Prepare request
front_image_b64 = encode_image("front_image.jpg")
side_image_b64 = encode_image("side_image.jpg")

# Using simplified format (recommended)
payload = {
    "front": front_image_b64,
    "side": side_image_b64
}

# Or using detailed format:
# payload = {
#     "input": {
#         "front_image": front_image_b64,
#         "side_image": side_image_b64
#     }
# }

# Make request to RunPod endpoint
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID/runsync",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json=payload
)

result = response.json()
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Logs

- View logs in RunPod dashboard under "Logs" tab
- Check container startup logs for initialization issues
- Monitor request processing logs for debugging

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not detect pose landmarks"**:
   - Ensure images clearly show the person
   - Check image quality and lighting
   - Verify person is visible from front/side as required

2. **"Image validation failed"**:
   - Check base64 encoding is correct
   - Ensure images are JPEG/PNG format
   - Verify minimum image size (100x100 pixels)

3. **Container startup timeout**:
   - Increase startup timeout in RunPod settings
   - Check if all dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify Docker image was built successfully

4. **Memory issues**:
   - Increase memory allocation in RunPod settings
   - MediaPipe requires at least 4GB RAM for optimal performance

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cold Start Optimization**:
   - Set minimum workers > 0 for faster response times
   - Consider keeping 1 worker warm for production

2. **Resource Tuning**:
   - Monitor CPU/memory usage
   - Adjust scaling thresholds based on load patterns
   - Use GPU instances if higher throughput needed

## Cost Optimization

- **Idle Timeout**: Set to 30-60 seconds to minimize costs
- **Min Workers**: Keep at 0 for development, consider 1 for production
- **Resource Allocation**: Start with minimum and scale up based on needs

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Store RunPod API keys securely
2. **Image Data**: Images are processed in memory and not stored
3. **Network**: Use HTTPS for all API communications
4. **Access Control**: Implement authentication in your client applications

## Files Created

The following files have been created for your RunPod deployment:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `runpod_handler.py` | Main serverless handler function |
| `Dockerfile` | Container configuration with optimized dependencies |
| `requirements_runpod.txt` | RunPod-specific Python dependencies |
| `build_and_deploy.sh` | Automated build and deployment script |
| `test_runpod_local.py` | Local testing script |
| `runpod_config.json` | Configuration template for RunPod |
| `RUNPOD_DEPLOYMENT.md` | This deployment guide |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployed endpoint** with your demo images
2. **Monitor performance** and adjust resources as needed
3. **Implement client applications** using the API
4. **Set up monitoring** and alerting for production use
5. **Consider CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments

## Support

For issues with:
- **RunPod Platform**: Check RunPod documentation or support
- **MediaPipe/OpenCV**: Refer to respective documentation
- **API Logic**: Review the posture analyzer implementation

## Updates and Maintenance

To update your deployment:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Test locally with `python test_runpod_local.py`
3. Run `./build_and_deploy.sh` to rebuild and push
4. Update the endpoint in RunPod dashboard with new image
5. Test the updated endpoint

Your posture measurement API is now ready for serverless deployment on RunPod! ðŸš€
